# Tokens

For the most up-to-date list of supported tokens and their contract addresses on Status Network, please refer to our official [Status Network Token List repository](https://github.com/status-im/status-network-token-list).

This repository contains:
- Token addresses for both L1 (Sepolia) and L2 (Status Network)
- Token metadata (decimals, symbols, etc.)
- Bridge contract mappings
- App tokens deployed on Status Network

The token list is maintained and updated regularly to ensure accuracy and security of token bridging operations.
