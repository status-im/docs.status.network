# Status Network: The Gasless Layer 2

Status Network is the first natively gasless Ethereum L2, optimized for social apps and games, featuring sustainable public funding for developers through native yield and DEX fees. Built on the Linea zkEVM stack, it provides high-performance, gas-free transactions while ensuring economic sustainability through a novel funding model.

## Key Features

- **Gasless Transactions** 

Developers can create seamless experiences and users can transact freely without worrying about gas fees.

- **Native Yield and Fees** 

To sustain the L2 operation and support developers, Status Network is funded through a combination of native yield and fees coming from its native apps, starting with a DEX.

- **Sustainable Public Funding**

The apps funding pool, governed by token holders, continuously allocates capital from native yield and fees to onchain builders.

- **High-Performance Execution**

Status Network is built on Linea's zkEVM rollup stack, ensuring fast and secure transactions.

- **Spam Protection via RLN**

Rate-Limiting Nullifiers (RLN) prevent spam and DDoS attacks while maintaining a fair allocation of free transactions per user and apps.

- **Deep Integration with IFT**

Status Network is natively integrated with Status Wallet, Keycard, Waku and Codex, all part of [IFT](https://free.technology).
