Karma provides gasless transaction privileges and reputation across Status Network.
This section helps you integrate both gasless behavior and tier-aware product logic in your app.

## Start Here

**Handling transactions?**

- Start with [Gasless Integration](/build-for-karma/guides/gasless-integration) to use `linea_estimateGas` as your single source of truth for gasless vs premium-fee outcomes.

**Gating features by reputation?**

- Continue with [Reputation Integration](/build-for-karma/guides/reputation-integration) to read Karma balances and tiers onchain, gate contracts, and design tier-aware frontends.
